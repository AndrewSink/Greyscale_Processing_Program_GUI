# Greyscale_Processing_Program_GUI

Convert a color image to a greyscale image (now with a fancy GUI!)

![Greyscale Program GUI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46334898/89680367-d067b780-d8c0-11ea-91b4-915762bd3ac1.png)


This program was designed as a quick test of the Processing programming language (http://processing.org), and will require Processing to run.

You'll need to import the ControlP5 library and install it in your Processing libraries directory: http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/.

This is an updated version of my first Greyscale Processing program: https://github.com/AndrewSink/Greyscale_Conversion_Program

The intent of this program is to get more familiar with the Processing PDE and eventually create a more robust image processor for use with drawing plotters.

**KNOWN BUGS: 
1. Files longer the GUI will load partially off-screen, but 'SAVE' will still capture the full image.**
